# AssetHost

AssetHost is an attempt to create a one-stop-shop for hosting and linking 
to media assets that are intended for inclusion in news stories.  The goal is 
to create a hub that multiple frontend CMS systems can hook into, querying 
images, videos and documents from one source and enabling the easier 
interchange of data.
